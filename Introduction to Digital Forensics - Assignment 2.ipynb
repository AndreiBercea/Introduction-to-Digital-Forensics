    "For this assignment, a previously captured trace of a real life DDoS attack is examined. The goal of this exercise is to find out the details of the attack as well as exclude packets not part of the attack. This serves both as practice in examining packets as well as getting better at analysing and evaluating the data gathered by a packet sniffer."

Traffic FROM the victim to the IP addresses in the network trace are NOT part of the attack. Tip: isolate 1 source and 1 destination IP and see if the same pattern applies to the other source IP addresses.**\n",
