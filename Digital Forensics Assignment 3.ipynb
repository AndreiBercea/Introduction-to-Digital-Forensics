In this particular one, the most common protocol is 80/ESSYN. For this statistic, we looked at the most repetitive entry of columns E and D combined (i.e. port service type & type).\n"

    "It was insightful, being able to go behind the curtains and take a peek at the database of a shady business, as is a booter website. It sheds some light on the fact that no actions you take come without repercussions. Even though services such as a booter website or even a VPN provider try to advertise anonymity, in most cases the trail left behind will be long enough for the respective authorities to identify the individual/entity in question."
